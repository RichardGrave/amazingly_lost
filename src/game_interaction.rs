// TODO:RG
// Here I want to handle a collision detection between a (invisible) bubble around
// the player. Maybe 3 by 3 that can collide with interaction tiles.
// E.g. a Sleeping bear -> make snoring sounds.
// Or Leprechaun -> that asks for gold or something like that.
// Another idea is to activate light sources on touch -> maybe a big firefly?
