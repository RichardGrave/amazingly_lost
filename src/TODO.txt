* Need more images for walls, open tiles, etc.
    - Find texture packs online? -> Free ones?
    - Same for sound and connect sounds to (special) images?
      For player collision detection with the special images making then a sound. -> Sleeping bear = snoring
* Refactor in smaller function/methods if possible.
* Add a bigger collision box around the player to trigger sounds/music when comming near a special tile.
* Darkness and light sources. Radiance?
* UI menus etc.
* Saving all DEFAULT files (images/sounds/music/etc.) that are needed in the binary
  and when they are not found in the file structure (on disk) then add them.
* Game items -> tools for more light, door/keys, maybe teleportation or a ladder to go over walls?
* Timer -> how fast you have found the exit
        -> or to complete the maze within a certain amount of time?
* Point system -> Bonus items to find
               -> faster completion of the maze gives more points?
