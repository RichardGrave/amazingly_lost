GAME:
      Splashscreen?  -> when starting game.
      Graphics -> Pixel Art
      Sound/Music
      Menu -> maze size
      Themes
      Add default files to executable -> create dir with assets
      Better movement -> player graphics.
      Darkness -> circle radius -> what player can see
                  -> some tiles give light. -> glow mushrooms, house(exit).
                  -> some don't give light, but show things -> owls eyes
      Player figure -> Blimpy a colord levitating blob

CODE:
      Use Query mutated -> player and camera?
      Player -> parent of camera? or other way around
      Optimize -> lifetimes/refs
      MazeTiles -> use Refs -> also for solution -> no more x and y positions
      Better file structures
      LAYERS -> for tiles -> z-axis -> start/path always last axis
                  -> then player -> rest is per row +1 z-axis
      End game -> reaching exit
      Determine spritesize by windowsize

MORE:
      Find tools for this -> music
      Find tutorials -> pixelart
      Look at more examples for Bevy stuff


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We need a grid with maze walls between every MazeTile.

* (#) First setup the entire grid with outer walls.
      And inner walls that never change.
      We can use random objects for the inner and outer walls
      ike stone, tree, hole, mushroom,
      or something with a theme, like a pumpkin (halloween), christmas tree, snowman
* (G) Goto spots where a player can start from (or exit).
* (- or |) for blocking of directions that can be open or closed
      That also can have the same random object as pillars or walls

# = permanent wall
| = can be used for other walls or ground
- = can be used for other walls or ground

# # # # # # # # #
# G | G | G | G #
# - # - # - # - #
# G | G | G | G #
# # # # # # # # #

After the standard generation:
Fill in the - and | places with other tiles.
1 tile for all the walls, grounds, exit and the player like this:
S = Starting point, P = player, E = Exit, @ = next spot where we can go (ground)
- or | are the tiles that block a direction (walls)

# # # # # # # # #
# S @ @ | @ @ E #
# - # @ # @ # - #
# @ @ P @ @ @ @ #
# # # # # # # # #
