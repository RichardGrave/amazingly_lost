// TODO:RG need to implement music and sounds

// Load and play all the sounds and music
// Need some system that connects certain tiles to sounds
// So we can trigger them if we get close to them -> like a snoring bear

// Also, use music like with the game_flow with certain game states.
// Use events for the ambient sounds

// Use it like this?
// fn setup(asset_server: Res<AssetServer>, audio: Res<Audio>) {
//     let music = asset_server.load("sounds/Windless Slopes.mp3");
//     audio.play(music);
// }
